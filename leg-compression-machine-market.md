<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Leg Compression Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Compression</li><li>Intermittent Compression</li><li>Sequential Compression</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The leg compression machine market features three main types: continuous compression, intermittent compression, and sequential compression. Continuous compression machines provide a steady and uniform pressure to promote blood circulation. Intermittent compression systems apply pressure in cycles, allowing for rest periods that enhance venous return and reduce edema. Sequential compression devices use a programmed pattern, gradually inflating and deflating different sections to mimic natural muscle movement, thereby improving lymphatic flow and circulation effectively. Each type caters to specific therapeutic needs.</p></p>
